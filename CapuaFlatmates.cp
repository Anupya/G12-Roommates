// OFFICIAL ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS [Grade 12]
// You are in the ancient roman town of Capua of 10 houses, with a population of 15 people, each
// with their own individual name, address, monthly salary, and bank account. The Almighty
// Caesar Augustus wants you to keep track of the rooming arrangements within the city for 2
// years.  Everyone started off with 100 denarii in their account, and has a randomly pre-set
// monthly salary between 10 and 50 denarii. The town starts off with 10 people (chosen at
// random) moving in together at the beginning of the year.
// a. Every month, two random people get together and live together in one of the houses. If one of them already living with another person, another two people get together
//   i. When two people move in, they pool their bank account into one account
// b. Every month, one big roommate clash breaks out.  Two people will split their joint account in half, each taking half the money, and will the first available house.
// c. Every month, everyone gets their monthly salary and puts it into their savings account (assume they forage for food, donâ€™t use electricity, and are tax evaders).
// Output the money and address of each person after each month.
// At the end, output the money and address of each person, the current roommates in pairs, as well as stating the longest surviving roommate relationship.
